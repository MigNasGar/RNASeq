# Bioinformatics - RNAseq Analysis

This repository contains the main codes that I used for the analysis of RNAseq data from the laboratory of molecular biology of pathogens (LBMP) of the Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo (UNIFESP).

* `up_or_down_genes` this code does a simple logical test using a .tabular file from DESeq2 as input. The parameters used were fdr and log2fc

* `sE_GO` this code uses the simplifyEnrichment library to perform a Gene Ontology Term Enrichment
